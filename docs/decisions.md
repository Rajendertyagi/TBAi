# Architecture Decisions

Recorded so future changes have context. Add new decisions here.

## Stack choices

- **@assistant-ui/react + @assistant-ui/ai-sdk** — Provides chat message state,
  streaming transport, message rendering, and tool-call UI out of the box.
  Library-first; avoids reimplementing chat primitives. Provider-agnostic.
- **AI SDK v7** — Primary AI layer (`streamText`, `convertToModelMessages`,
  `toUIMessageStreamResponse`). Unifies provider SDKs behind one interface and
  produces the UI-message stream protocol that assistant-ui consumes.
- **Hono + Bun** — Lightweight, TypeScript-native server. Hono's routing/middleware
  keep the backend small; Bun runs TS directly with fast startup.
- **SQLite via `bun:sqlite`** — Local-first persistent storage with zero external
  services. Satisfies the persistence requirement without a server process.
- **Zustand** — Minimal shared client/UI state. Not used as a persistence layer.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility-first styling with design tokens in `globals.css`.

## Removed dependencies (with reasons)

- **`assistant-stream`** — Only used by `createProviderStream` (dead code; no route
  called it). Its `createAssistantStreamResponse` emits the older *Assistant Stream
  Protocol*, which `AssistantChatTransport` does **not** consume (it expects the AI
  SDK UI-message stream). `streamText().toUIMessageStreamResponse()` is the
  library-provided, correct equivalent. Removed.
- **`drizzle-orm` + `drizzle-kit`** — Configured but never used; the app talks to
  SQLite directly via `bun:sqlite`. Removed to keep the dependency surface small.
  If a query builder is later needed, re-evaluate and record here.

## Security model

- API keys are backend-only. The browser sends `providerId`, never the key.
  `GET /api/providers` returns only metadata + `credentialConfigured`. (See `security.md`.)

## Credential encryption: local DEK, no master password

- **Decision:** Provider API keys are encrypted at rest with **AES-256-GCM** under a
  random **per-install Data Encryption Key (DEK)**, stored in the `credential_key`
  table. There is **no master password, unlock screen, or login**, and **no OS keychain /
  credential-manager** dependency. The user enters a key once and TBAi remembers it
  automatically across restarts.
- **Why:** TBAi is a personal-use, portable application. A master-password / unlock
  workflow was prototyped and then removed — it added friction (create/unlock/lock UI,
  Argon2id derivation on every unlock) with no benefit for a single-user portable tool
  where the app folder is already trusted. Portability (the data folder travels with the
  app) and convenience were prioritized.
- **Why not OS keychain:** avoids per-OS backends (WinCred / Keychain / Secret Service)
  and keeps the app fully portable and dependency-light. The `CredentialStore` interface
  is the single swap point if OS storage is later desired.
- **Why not a hardcoded key:** the DEK is generated randomly per install, so no universal
  key ships in source.
- **Trade-off / limitation:** because the DEK lives in the same local DB as the
  ciphertext, anyone with read access to the app's `data/` folder can recover the keys.
  Accepted for a personal tool; documented in `security.md` threat model.
- **Dependencies:** `@noble/ciphers` (AES-256-GCM). `@noble/hashes` was evaluated for
  Argon2id but dropped when the master-password approach was removed; random bytes use
  `crypto.getRandomValues` and hex via `Buffer`. Crypto is isolated in
  `src/services/credentials.ts`; `src/lib/redact.ts` scrubs secrets from logs/errors.

## Conversation persistence: assistant-ui thread architecture

- **Decision:** Persist conversation/message history using assistant-ui's **native thread
  runtime** (`RemoteThreadListRuntime` + `RemoteThreadListAdapter` + `ThreadHistoryAdapter`),
  backed by the existing SQLite store. We do **not** introduce a second Zustand
  conversation/message store.
- **Why:** The runtime already owns thread/message state; a parallel store would duplicate
  it and drift out of sync. `ThreadHistoryAdapter.withFormat(storageFormatAdapter)` lets us
  persist exactly what the AI SDK runtime serializes (`{ id, parent_id, format, content }`)
  without re-implementing message serialization. `RemoteThreadListRuntime` wires the
  thread list, selection, and `threadId` so a selected thread survives reload.
- **Why not a custom store:** Minimum-custom-code principle — chat message state, history
  load/append, and the history UI (`ThreadListPrimitive` / `ThreadListItemPrimitive`) are all
  provided by the library. Custom code is limited to two thin HTTP adapters.
- **Storage format:** `messages.content` stores the runtime's opaque storage format as JSON
  (verified as `ai-sdk/v6`); `messages.format` records the format tag so it can be decoded on
  load. We never parse message internals.
- **Schema:** `conversations.status` (`regular`/`archived`) drives the regular vs. archived
  lists; `messages.parent_id`/`order_seq` preserve the message tree and order. Migrations are
  idempotent (guarded `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN`; the legacy `role NOT NULL` messages table
  is recreated when upgrading an old DB).
- **Rename caveat:** `ThreadListItemPrimitive.Title` is read-only, so rename is implemented as
  a `window.prompt` + direct `PATCH /api/conversations/:id` (not via the primitive).

## Thinking-model latency

- `gemini-flash-latest` resolves to a thinking model; we disable thinking with
  `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget = 0` for non-lite models to reduce latency.
  Revisit if the provider changes model aliasing.

## MCP client: official SDK + AI SDK v7 tool wrappers (server-side)

- **Decision:** TBAi connects to MCP servers through the **official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`**
  (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client` `Client` + `StdioClientTransport` /
  `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` / `SSEClientTransport`, notification schemas from
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types`). Discovered tools are wrapped with **AI SDK v7 `tool()`** and
  merged into the chat route's `tools` map. The MCP `Client` runs **server-side**; the browser only
  drives config/status over a `/api/mcp` REST API.
- **Why this SDK:** it is the canonical, spec-track implementation and already handles the three
  transports, capability negotiation, and notification schemas. Hand-rolling JSON-RPC/MCP framing
  would duplicate a large, evolving standard and risk interop bugs. Minimum-custom-code principle.
- **Why AI SDK v7 `tool()` and not `@ai-sdk/mcp`:** wrapping each discovered tool ourselves keeps the
  connection lifecycle, live status, cancellation (`abortSignal` → `client.callTool`), and
  capability surfacing (tools/resources/prompts, server info) fully under our control for the GUI and
  for the chat route's tool merge. `@ai-sdk/mcp` hides that lifecycle behind its own client.
- **Why server-side execution:** MCP servers may be local subprocesses (STDIO) or remote HTTP/SSE
  endpoints; running the `Client` in the backend avoids shipping server credentials/CLIs to the
  browser and keeps one connection per server for the whole app. Tool names are namespaced
  `mcp__<serverId>__<toolName>` to avoid collisions and stay stable across reconnects.
- **Transports:** STDIO (command + args + env), Streamable HTTP, and legacy SSE are all implemented.
  HTTP/SSE auth is constructed from `auth_type`/`auth_token` (bearer / basic / oauth); the token is
  encrypted at rest with the same local DEK as provider keys (`encryptSecret`/`decryptSecret`).
- **Status / resilience:** per-connection status + a recent-events buffer (progress, list-changed,
  logging, errors) are surfaced to the GUI; unexpected transport closes trigger bounded reconnect
  (`MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` = 5, `RECONNECT_DELAY_MS` = 5000). `testConnection(input)` validates a
  server without persisting it.
- **Verification:** STDIO + Streamable HTTP verified via `scripts/test-mcp.ts`; the REST API verified
  via `scripts/test-mcp-api.mjs` against a running server. SSE is implemented but not yet exercised
  against a live legacy SSE server. Desktop Commander MCP (`npx -y @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest`)
  is the intended first real-world test server; it requires Node/npm/npx on `PATH` (absent in the
  current Windows test env, which has only Bun), so it was validated via a Bun-based minimal MCP
  server instead.
- **Follow-up (now implemented):** MCP resources/prompts are insertable into the chat composer from the
  MCP panel (`readResource`/`getPrompt` + REST + `unstable_useComposerInput().setText`); roots, sampling,
  and elicitation are consumed via `setRequestHandler` for `ListRootsRequestSchema` /
  `CreateMessageRequestSchema` / `ElicitRequestSchema`, with elicitation surfaced through a global modal
  (`/api/mcp/elicit/pending` + `/elicit/resolve`). See `mcp.md` "Advanced client capabilities".
- **Still deferred / pending live test:** a live SSE server run, and end-to-end sampling/elicitation with
  a real provider key + a server that uses them during a chat.

## Rich response rendering: official assistant-ui registry components

Assistant messages now render rich content using the official assistant-ui
composition rather than a custom renderer (ADR-equivalent of the AIPM
project's ADR-009, re-implemented natively for this codebase):

- **Markdown**: the official markdown-text registry component on top of
  @assistant-ui/react-markdown (MarkdownTextPrimitive) + emark-gfm
  (GFM tables, task lists, strikethrough). Streaming-safe: parses
  incrementally with smooth reveal; data-status mirrors part state.
- **Syntax highlighting**: the official shiki-highlighter element over
  eact-shiki. Tokenization is deferred while a code block streams and
  settles afterwards without layout shift.
- **Code blocks**: language label + copy button ship in the registry
  component's CodeHeader; long lines scroll inside the block.
- **Diffs**: the official diff-viewer element (parse-diff + diff),
  routed from `diff fences through a small SyntaxHighlighter override.
  Unified view, add/del coloring, +/- stats.
- **Reasoning/tools**: official easoning, 	ool-group, 	ool-fallback
  elements rendered through MessagePrimitive.GroupedParts +
  groupPartByType (current API; components.ChainOfThought is legacy).
  Reasoning renders only when the provider emits reasoning parts; thinking
  budgets are configured per provider (see Thinking-model latency above).
- **Dependencies added**: @assistant-ui/react-markdown, emark-gfm,
  eact-shiki (brings shiki), diff, parse-diff, adix-ui (unified
  package for Collapsible/Tooltip), 	w-shimmer (CSS). cva,
  clsx, 	ailwind-merge were already present.

### Custom code ledger (rendering)
| Custom piece | Size | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `diff -> DiffViewer routing (HighlightingSyntax in ChatWindow.tsx) | ~15 lines | MarkdownText's SyntaxHighlighter slot is language-agnostic; routing diff fences to the official DiffViewer is app glue. |
| prettyToolName (rendering-glue.ts) | ~10 lines | MCP tool names are mcp__<serverId>__<toolName>; displayed as "server - tool" for readability. |
| asChild adaptation in tooltip-icon-button.tsx | 1 line | Installed radix-ui@1.6.7 TooltipTrigger supports asChild but not the newer ender prop used by the registry file. |
| ui/button + ui/tooltip + ui/collapsible + ui/textarea | ~150 lines | Registry elements import these shadcn primitives; this project had a different Button/Input/Textarea set in ui.tsx. Adapted to the existing dark-first token style. |

Everything else is verbatim official registry code.

## ADR: approval lifecycle + history pruning durability (2026-09-10)

- **Regression fixed:** the Gemini-400 pruner treated
  `approval-responded (approved, no output yet)` as stale and deleted it —
  so the continuation request reached the server without the approval
  decision, nothing executed, and the model re-raised the gate in a loop
  (observed live: 4× write_file/login.html, all approved, none executed).
- **Lifecycle rule now:** per toolCallId — (1) a resolved occurrence
  (output-available/error/denied, including cancel-synthesized errorText)
  always wins; (2) otherwise the last approval decision (requested or
  responded) is kept **only while no user turn follows it** (active
  continuation); (3) no result + no decision = genuinely stale → dropped.
  Assistant turns left step-start-only are dropped; adjacent text-only user
  turns merge.
- **Approval lifetime decision:** an approval is actionable only within its
  continuation. If the continuation is lost and the conversation moves on,
  the decision expires (part dropped) and a fresh approval is required —
  destructive actions are never executed retroactively on an unrelated future
  message. Approval state lives in per-thread message history only; it never
  crosses threads and is never persisted anywhere else.
- **Production-path test guarantee:** `prepareModelMessages`
  (`src/lib/model-messages.ts`) is the one prune+convert path used by both
  the chat route and the integration tests — a test can no longer bypass the
  pruner by mirroring the route.
- **UI:** approved-but-not-executed parts render "Approved — will execute
  with your next message…" / "Approved — executing…", never "Failed".
- **Diagnostics:** `stale_part_pruned`, `approval_preserved` (chat scope),
  `tool_execution_started/completed` (tools scope) — toolCallIds only, never
  content.

## ADR: centralized logging + request correlation (2026-09-10)

- **Decision:** one canonical server logger (`src/lib/logger.ts`: debug/info/
  warn/error, scope + stable snake_case event names, structured fields) used
  by HTTP, chat, provider, MCP, native tools, and storage boundaries. A
  matching frontend logger (`web/src/lib/logger.ts`) mirrors the contract with
  a console backend and global error hooks. No SaaS, no new runtime deps.
- **Correlation:** every inbound request gets `req_<id>` (trusted incoming
  `x-request-id` accepted only if `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`), carried in an
  AsyncLocalStorage context — never global mutable state, concurrent requests
  isolated (unit-proven). Errors returned to the client include `requestId`;
  stream errors append `[ref:req_…]` to the user-visible copy so a user can
  report "Error reference req_123".
- **Levels/destinations:** dev → debug (console, human-readable), production
  → info (JSON-lines file `data/tbai.log`, size-rotated 5 MB × 3). Overrides:
  `TBAI_LOG_LEVEL`, `TBAI_LOG_FILE`, `TBAI_LOG_MAX_MB`, `TBAI_LOG_KEEP`.
- **Redaction:** structured key redaction (api key/authorization/token/
  password/cookie/credential/dek…) plus value-pattern scrubbing
  (sk-/AIza/xox/Bearer). Unit-proven negatives: API keys, Authorization
  headers, DEK material never appear in log output.
- **AI diagnostics:** `AI_DEBUG_REQUESTS=true` emits a sanitized structural
  record (`ai_request_diagnostic`) of the outbound model request — roles,
  part types, tool names/schemas, toolCall/approval ids, signature presence
  (`{present,length}`) — never raw user text, tool argument values, or
  signature values. This is what made the Gemini 400 root cause observable
  (orphaned duplicate functionCall turns + consecutive user turns; fixed
  separately by `pruneStaleMessages`).
- **Normalization:** one `normalizeError()` (type, message, cause, status,
  code; stack only locally) feeds every error log; user responses never
  receive stacks.
- **Why custom:** no dependency was added because the contract (AsyncStorage
  context + redaction + rotation) is ~300 lines total; pino/winston would add
  transitive weight without changing the semantics we need.
- **Ledger:** `src/lib/logger.ts` ~330 lines, `src/lib/ai-diagnostics.ts`
  ~200, `web/src/lib/logger.ts` ~110, wiring ~120 lines across routes/
  manager/server; tests ~230 lines.
- **Live Logs panel:** in-memory ring buffer (1000 post-redaction entries)
  inside the logger + SSE endpoint (`/api/logs/stream`, backlog + push,
  heartbeat, abort-clean) + polling fallback (`/api/logs/recent?since=`).
  Client (`LogsPanel.tsx`, ~230 lines) filters level/scope/text client-side
  (≤1000 entries — no server-side query needed), pause/resume, auto-scroll.
  No dependencies; same redacted data as console/file, nothing new exposed.

## ADR: industry-standard dual-theme UI (2026-09-10)

- **Decision:** full shadcn CSS-variable contract (`:root` light + `.dark`
  overrides, oklch-free hex tokens preserving the existing dark look,
  `@theme inline` bridge, `@custom-variant dark`, `color-scheme` per theme)
  with a Vite ThemeProvider (`light|dark`, `localStorage`, class on
  `<html>`, FOUC-blocking pre-apply script, default dark). No `next-themes`
  (Next-only), no media-query strategy (toggle requires class strategy).
- **No inline styles, no hardcoded values:** every surface uses theme tokens
  (`success`/`warning` pairs added; red/green/amber literals eliminated;
  `text-[11px]` unified to `text-xs`; diff sizes mapped to scale).
- **Kept native `<select>`** (color-scheme makes the OS popup follow the
  theme; Radix rewrite unjustified for short single-choice lists), kept
  registry `elements/*` frozen (zero hardcoded colors found inside).
- **Canonicalized** `ui/button.tsx` variants/sizes, `ui/input.tsx` (new),
  `ui/textarea.tsx`; collapsed `ui.tsx` duplicates into re-exports.
- **Bugs fixed in the same pass:** red error strip on every message (gated
  with `MessagePrimitive.Error`), transparent thread menu (popover tokens),
  card-width mismatch (`ToolCard w-full`), tiny diffs (`w-full` + loose-fence
  fallback), stale rename (runtime `rename()` + inline editor), reload
  landing (threadId hydrate/persist/validate).
- **Feel:** `tw-animate-css` activates the registry's entrance animations;
  message entrance, ScrollToBottom, Copy/Reload action bars, icon composer
  with tooltips + autofocus, view-switch fade, sidebar active indicator.
- **Ledger:** globals.css rewrite (~140), theme provider + toggle (~90),
  ui/* canonicalization (~120 net), renderer/card/diff fixes (~60),
  rename + restore (~110), feel additions (~60).

## ADR: resume-404 self-healing (2026-09-10)

- **Symptom:** `GET /api/chat/resume/:id → 404` retried on every reload.
  Root cause chain (verified in installed packages): the server's resumable
  store is in-memory, so any restart wipes it; finished streams are
  finalized; and error-terminated streams never tripped our finish detector
  (it only watched `finish` + abort markers). The stale stream id stayed in
  per-thread `sessionStorage`, so each reload re-attempted the dead resume —
  and the failed attempt left the thread in error state.
- **Fix (client only, official hooks):** `isFinishEvent` now also treats
  `"type":"error"` SSE chunks as terminal (markers match raw SSE text only;
  message content is JSON-escaped and cannot trip them), and `useChatRuntime`
  gets `onResumeError` which clears the stale per-thread resume pointer.
  Persisted messages are never touched — only the pointer clears. One 404,
  then never again.
- **Not changed:** the server 404 itself is correct behavior (unknown stream
  ⇒ 404); no server code touched.

## ADR: assistant-ui DevTools guard fix (2026-09-10)

- **Problem:** `<DevToolsModal/>` rendered in every browser bundle yet waited
  forever ("Waiting for assistant-ui instance..."). Root cause is upstream,
  not TBAi: the modal renders unless `process` exists with
  `NODE_ENV=production`, while `AssistantRuntimeProvider` registers the
  runtime only under that same condition — and browsers have no `process` at
  all, so the panel renders and the registration never happens.
- **Decision (option B):** `main.tsx` installs a minimal dev-only shim
  (`window.process.env.NODE_ENV="development"`, non-clobbering, only under
  `import.meta.env.DEV`); `App.tsx` mounts `<DevToolsModal/>` only under
  `import.meta.env.DEV`. Verified preconditions: Vite injects no `process`,
  nothing depends on its absence, devtools package is `sideEffects:false`.
- **Verified:** production `vite build` output contains zero DevTools strings
  and no devtools chunk. Debugging aid only; not a TBAi feature — no further
  DevTools work planned.

## ADR-017 — Built-in scheduler / cron (Bun-native, SQLite-backed)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-11
- **Context:** TBAi needs unattended scheduled AI runs (one-time + recurring)
  without adding infrastructure. The project rules forbid Redis/Postgres/
  Docker and extra scheduler services.
- **Decision:** SQLite (`scheduler_jobs` / `scheduler_runs`) is the source of
  truth; `Bun.cron(expr, cb, { timezone })` drives recurring jobs (verified
  against installed Bun 1.4.2: 5 fields, no seconds, `timezone`/`tz` option,
  handle has `stop()`/`unref()`); `setTimeout` drives one-time `exec_at`
  jobs. Timers are an execution cache, rebuilt from the DB on startup, job
  change, and recovery. No `node-cron`/Bree/BullMQ/Redis, no polling loop.
- **Duplicate prevention:** UNIQUE(job_id, occurrence_id) claim insert —
  recurring slot `cron-<utc-minute>`, once `once`, manual `manual-<unique>`.
  Conflict ⇒ already claimed ⇒ no execution. Retries update the same run
  row (`attempt`++). No "exactly once" claim across provider side effects.
- **Recovery:** orphaned `running`/`scheduled` runs → `interrupted` (never
  auto-retried); recurring timers rebuilt; pending once timers rebuilt;
  overdue once jobs follow the missed-run policy (≤ grace → run once,
  else `missed` + disabled, never late).
- **Unattended safety:** destructive native tools always throw an
  approval-required refusal in scheduled runs (approval cannot be granted,
  so gates cannot be bypassed); MCP tools excluded in V1; workspaces
  confined to the TBAi root via the same traversal/symlink policy.
- **Reuse, not duplication:** execution goes through canonical `getModel` +
  AI SDK `generateText` (no second provider system, no second streaming
  stack); thinking mapping mirrors the chat route; jobs store explicit
  provider/model/thinking/workspace/prompt (never the active UI state).
- **V1 limits:** minute granularity; `skip_if_running` only; no MCP tools;
  no full message mirroring (excerpt on run row); one row per occurrence.
- **Ledger:** `schedulerTypes.ts` (~80), `cron.ts` (~380, validation +
  presets + tz-aware next-run via Intl only), `schedulerStore.ts` (~330),
  `schedulerExecution.ts` (~300), `scheduler.ts` (~300), `routes/scheduler.ts`
  (~330), `SchedulerPanel.tsx` + store (~700), tests (~330). Zero new
  dependencies. Full detail: `docs/scheduler.md`.

## ADR-018 — Application foundation (router, tabs, modules)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-11
- **Context:** Every feature re-litigated navigation/state placement
  (ad-hoc `activeView` switching, an 810-line `routes/index.ts`, a
  monolithic SettingsPanel, an unbounded sidebar list). Needed: one stable
  platform for dashboard, multi-chat tabs, future split-screen, and all
  settings areas — verified against the ecosystem compatibility study
  (React Router v8, assistant-ui multi-thread, AI SDK v7, shadcn).
- **Router: `react-router` v8 `createHashRouter`, Data Mode, no loaders
  initially.** v7 is security-maintenance-only, so v8 (`8.3.1` installed,
  exports verified under Bun 1.4.2) — not the v7 originally sketched.
  Hash routing picked over BrowserRouter: identical Data-Mode API, zero
  server rewrites, works from `file://` (ElectroBun desktop). Framework
  Mode explicitly rejected (no SSR/file-routes needed). One new
  dependency; recorded here per dependency discipline.
- **Tabs without duplicate runtimes:** open tabs = Zustand id list +
  `groupId` (`"main"`; split-screen later adds groups, no rewrite). ONE
  shared `useRemoteThreadListRuntime`; tab switch = `threadId` prop
  change. The runtime caches per-thread runtimes, so background streams
  survive switches (docs-confirmed; live E2E must still prove it). No
  message store, no mirrored state. `/chat/new` = unsent draft;
  first-send id attaches via `attachRealId`; stale ids redirect to a
  draft; tab state persists in localStorage with validation.
- **Backend split:** `routes/index.ts` → composition root + per-concern
  modules (`chat/tools/providers/conversations/memories`, existing
  `mcp/logs/scheduler` untouched). Identical paths, no logic changes.
- **Frontend modules:** `app/` (router/shell/adapter/URL-sync) +
  `features/<name>/` + `components/shared/` (settings grammar). Moved,
  not rewritten: providers page (ex-SettingsPanel), appearance, workspace
  (existing sysinfo endpoint only), dashboard, chat views.
- **Sidebar anti-flood:** Recent-5 + Show More (+5, session-only) over the
  existing adapter paging; search stays server-side; settings always
  visible.
- **Ledger:** `react-router@8.3.1` (only new dep); ~10 new frontend files,
  5 new backend route modules; `SettingsPanel.tsx` deleted after its move;
  `tests/unit/foundation.test.ts` added (tab store + route→nav map).
- **Follow-up (same session, codeg re-study):** unified tabs (chat + page
  tabs in one strip, old string-shape state migrates automatically);
  dashboard deleted (`/` → active tab or fresh chat — codeg has no
  dashboard); sidebar bottom icon-grid replaced with full-width rows (New
  Chat, Chat, conversations, one Settings row); settings sub-sidebar added
  (`SettingsLayout`, entries from `navigation.ts`); Memory/MCP/Scheduler/
  Logs converted onto the shared settings grammar without logic changes.
- **Not done here:** split-screen UI (model ready), MCP/scheduler/memory
  logic (untouched), shadcn CLI primitives (adopt incrementally).

## ADR: assistant-ui docs audit — explicit non-replacements (2026-09-10)

Full docs-index audit (all guides, primitives, runtimes, tools, migrations,
utilities) against this codebase returned **zero replacements**. Recorded so
future agents don't re-litigate:

- **Streamdown ≠ DiffViewer replacement.** Covers ~60% of the markdown stack,
  needs new packages (`@assistant-ui/react-streamdown`, `streamdown`), and its
  own guide says to keep custom `diff`-language renderers. Partial
  modernization at best, not a deletion.
- **MessageTiming hook complements but can't replace `MessageUsage`.**
  Disjoint data (hook: durations/speed; ours: backend model + finish reason).
- **CLI `add` rejected.** Next.js/shadcn-oriented; `add --overwrite` would
  destroy intentionally-diverged glue (Radix `asChild` shim, DiffViewer
  routing, streaming guards). `upgrade --dry` / `info` may be used around
  version bumps.
- **`@assistant-ui/react-mcp` rejected.** Browser OAuth + plain-text local
  storage would violate the secrets-stay-server-side invariant.
- **`AISDKToolkit`/`frontendTools` rejected.** Requires the excluded
  generative compiler + `@ai-sdk/mcp`. Our manual server/client split stands.
- **Persistence adapters verified compliant** with the custom-adapter contract
  (opaque `{id,parent_id,format,content}`, no content inspection).
- **MCP manager scope intentionally larger than docs.** Docs cover per-request
  static clients; ours is a persistent GUI-managed multi-server client with
  reconnect, sampling/elicitation/roots, and encrypted auth. No overlap to
  merge.
- **`useAssistantToolUI` migration verified complete** (zero remaining uses);
  `ThreadPrimitive.Empty` → `AuiIf` and `Messages components` → children fn
  migrated (were the last deprecated usages).
- **Resumable store stays in-memory** (documented dev default); the
  `ResumableStreamStore` interface is the future swap path, not a migration.

## ADR: native toolkit architecture (2026-09-10) — replaces human-tool UIs

- **Decision:** all 11 native tools are one `defineToolkit` registration
  (`web/src/tools/toolkit.ts`, `type: "backend"` render-only entries) wired via
  `AssistantRuntimeProvider config`; server owns contract + execution
  (`nativeTools` + `toolApproval` gates in `src/routes/index.ts`); zero human
  tools; `useAssistantToolUI`/`ToolRegistrations`/`ToolUIs.tsx` deleted.
- **Why:** the schema-only + `addResult()` arrangement stalled after approval
  (no `sendAutomaticallyWhen` was configured, and nothing in that design
  resubmitted the thread). Approval cards also conflated "UI supplies result"
  with "user authorizes server action". The toolkit + server-gate model makes
  each lifecycle explicit and uses only official mechanisms.
- **Why not the generative compiler:** the project has no `@assistant-ui/vite`
  plugin; `defineToolkit` passes explicit-`type` entries through unchanged
  (verified in installed `core@0.3.17`). Marker factories (`humanTool()` etc.)
  throw at runtime by design and are never called.
- **Why keep `/api/tools/*`:** manual/test/debug surface; removing them buys
  nothing while the new path proves itself. Deliberate temporary retention.
- **Continuation:** `sendAutomaticallyWhen` = tool-calls-complete OR
  approval-responses-complete (official `ai` helpers); backend-approval tools
  must use the approval predicate, never the human one.
- **Trade-offs/limits:** v0.0.4 transport drops rich approval prompts
  (prompt/options/text never render — plain allow/deny only); reload drops a
  pending gate by design; `outputSchema: z.unknown()` is loose on purpose.
- **Custom-code ledger:** `nativeTools` defs (~110 lines — model contract must
  live next to execution; AI SDK has no registry for it); toolkit entries +
  11 renderers (~330 lines — assistant-ui provides no file/process UI);
  `BackendToolView` gate dispatcher (~80 lines — three-state approval logic is
  app-specific); `AutoOpenToolGroup` (~20 lines — auto-open-while-running is
  not a registry behavior); `sendAutomaticallyWhen` wiring (~5 lines).

## Agentic human tools: coding + computer set (2026-09-10)

- **Pattern (doc-backed):** schema-only server tools + client "human tool" UIs that
  execute via `/api/tools/*` and feed results back with `addResult` — the exact
  pattern assistant-ui's Tool UI docs bless for "the entire execution happens
  through user interaction". No architecture change from the original 4 tools.
- **Tool set (11 total):** read/write/edit/run (original) + `list_dir`,
  `search_files`, `file_info` (auto-run) + `delete_file`, `process_kill`
  (Approve/Deny) + `process_list`, `system_info` (auto-run, read-only).
- **Approval policy:** reads auto-run; writes/deletes/commands/kills ask first.
  Server-side `toolApproval` gates were evaluated and rejected — they apply to
  server-executed tools, while ours execute in the UI.
- **Safety:** everything file-scoped stays inside `WORKSPACE_DIR` (traversal +
  symlink-escape rejected); `runKill` refuses pid ≤ 4 and the server's own pid;
  search skips `node_modules`/`.git`/binaries with caps; search `truncated`
  means strictly more hits than returned.
- **Debt:** `useAssistantToolUI` is deprecated upstream in favor of
  `defineToolkit` toolkits. New tools stay on the existing API for consistency;
  migrating all 11 UIs to toolkits is a separate future task.
- **Tests:** `tests/unit/tools.test.ts` runs against an isolated tmp workspace
  (`tests/setup.ts` now also sets `WORKSPACE_DIR`); `credentials.test.ts` no
  longer overwrites `DATA_DIR` or closes the shared db singleton (it broke
  parallel test files with "Database has closed").
- **Superseded same day:** the human-tool arrangement above was replaced by the
  toolkit ADR at the top of this section (server execution + server approval
  gates). Tool set, approval policy, safety rules and tests carry over
  unchanged; only the registration/execution/approval mechanism changed.

## Reconciliation (2026-09-10): streaming hardening + persistence UX + roots push

- **Abort propagation:** `c.req.raw.signal` → `streamText({abortSignal})` (route) and
  → `getAiTools(requestSignal)` → per-tool `callTool(..., {signal, timeout:120000})`
  with `options.abortSignal ?? requestSignal` fallback. No custom protocol.
- **Stream errors:** `sanitizeStreamError()` maps auth/rate-limit/network/abort to stable
  user copy + `logStreamDiagnostic()` server-side; `ErrorPrimitive.Root/Message`
  (`AssistantError` in ChatWindow) renders it per assistant message.
- **Resumable:** official `assistant-stream/resumable` in-memory context + resume route
  + per-thread `sessionStorage` keys + abort/finish `isFinishEvent`. Pinned
  `assistant-stream@0.3.41` in `web/package.json` (was transitive-only float risk).
- **Metadata:** official `messageMetadata` (`finish→{usage,finishReason}`,
  `finish-step→{modelId}`) + trivial `MessageUsage` readout from
  `message.metadata.custom` via `useAuiState`. No new tables; opaque persistence kept.
- **Content search:** FTS5 `conv_fts` sidecar + triggers + one-time backfill (additive,
  existing DBs preserved) with LIKE fallback; `list({search})` queries title + message
  content; adapter forwards `?search=`; Sidebar debounces 300ms + runtime reload, client
  title filter kept as fallback.
- **LoadMore:** official `ThreadListPrimitive.LoadMore` (auto-hides when no `nextCursor`);
  appends via existing adapter `after→offset` contract, no duplicate thread state.
- **Roots push:** client caps flipped to `roots:{listChanged:true}`; new
  `notifyRootsChanged(id)` → `client.sendRootsListChanged()`; roots/notes-only edits skip
  reconnect and push instead; `POST /servers/:id/roots/notify` exposed.
- **MCP SDK v1.30 vs v2:** STAY on v1.30 (deliberate debt). Push ships in installed v1.30;
  v2 needs package split, zod3→4, node>=20/Bun revalidation, handler-signature churn,
  era-negotiation design — disproportionate without a live-test window. Revisit when a
  2026-07-28-only server is required.

### Custom code ledger (reconciliation)| Custom piece | Size | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `sanitizeStreamError` + `logStreamDiagnostic` (redact.ts) | ~35 lines | AI SDK has no user-copy mapping; avoids raw SDK text in ErrorPrimitive. |
| `getAiTools(requestSignal)` fallback + timeout (manager.ts) | ~5 lines | AI SDK may call execute without options.abortSignal; request fallback + 120s cap. |
| `notifyRootsChanged` + reconnect-skip (manager.ts) + roots/notify route | ~45 lines | v1.30 SDK exposes the primitive but no manager wiring/route. |
| `conv_fts` sidecar + triggers + backfill + search SQL (db/storage) | ~60 lines | SQLite FTS needs app-side DDL/triggers; no ORM in this codebase. |
| `threadListSearchQuery` bridge + debounced reload (adapter/Sidebar) | ~20 lines | RemoteThreadListAdapter list() has no first-class search param in installed version. |
| `MessageUsage` readout (ChatWindow) | ~25 lines | Registry has no usage-footer element; reads official metadata.custom. |
| Progress tracker + TodoList renderer | ~180 lines (3 new files) | Agent work visibility derived from tool calls, not model-controlled. Server→client via data-tbai-progress part type. |

## ADR-016 — Server-derived agent progress stages (tbai-progress)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-10
- **Context:** Users need visibility into what the agent is doing during long tool chains. Model-controlled todo lists are unreliable (the model may skip, reorder, or omit them).
- **Decision:** Derive progress stages server-side from actual tool-call events using `onToolExecutionStart` / `onToolExecutionEnd` callbacks in `createUIMessageStream`. Group known tools into semantic categories (inspect/search/read/modify/run/system). Unknown/MCP tools map to a generic "Executing tools" stage. Multiple calls to the same category aggregate into one stage entry.
- **Data contract:** Each progress update is a `data-tbai-progress` data part (id: `"progress"`) with shape `{ kind: "tbai-progress", version: 1, stages: [{ id, label, status: "pending"|"active"|"completed"|"failed" }] }`. Partial updates are transient (live UI only); the final snapshot is non-transient and persists in the message history.
- **Client:** `TodoList` component registered as the `tbai-progress` data renderer via `makeAssistantDataUI` in `App.tsx`. Renders inside the assistant message via assistant-ui's data-part flow.
- **Rationale:** No model involvement means stages are always accurate. Hybrid persistence avoids bloating stored messages with intermediate snapshots. One renderer per app — no per-thread config needed.
